# Maximum Border Coverage After Removing Two Ranges

This program determines the maximum number of border points that remain covered after removing any two blocker ranges.

## Overview

- A number line from 1 to `n`.
- `q` blocker intervals are added, each covering a subrange.
- The goal is to choose two blocker intervals to remove such that the number of remaining covered points is maximized.
- Coverage means a point is included in at least one remaining blocker range.

## Input Format

- An integer `t`, the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - Two integers `n` and `q` â€” length of the number line and number of blocker ranges.
  - `q` lines follow, each containing two integers `l` and `r`, the endpoints of a blocker interval (inclusive).

## Output Format

- For each test case, print a single integer: the maximum number of positions that remain covered after removing any two blocker intervals.
