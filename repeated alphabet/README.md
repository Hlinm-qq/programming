# Unique Character Checker

This program checks if a given string contains any repeated lowercase alphabet characters.

## Overview

- Reads an integer `n` representing the length of the string.
- Reads `n` characters (assumed lowercase letters).
- Counts the frequency of each character.
- Determines if there is any repeated character.
- Prints a specific message depending on uniqueness.

## Input Format

- An integer `n`, the length of the string.
- Exactly `n` lowercase alphabetic characters (may include spaces in input but only letters count).

## Output Format

- Prints `"I'm the god of Knuckles!"` if any character repeats or if the string length is 1.
- Prints `"Different makes perfect"` if all characters are unique and the string length is more than 1.
